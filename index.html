                                        A serious problem of superstition and witch hunting prevailing in certain
                                        pockets of Assam leading to search for witches or evidence of witchcraft,
                                        often involving moral panic, mass hysteria and lynching Superstition is a
                                        belief in supernatural causality: that one event leads to the cause
                                        of another without any physical process linking the two events, such
                                        as astrology, omens, witchcraft, etc. that contradicts natural science.
                                        The word is often used pejoratively to refer to religious practices other
                                        than the one prevailing in a given society although the prevailing religion
                                        may contain just as many supernatural beliefs. In it innocent people are
                                        hacked to death by their fellow villagers. The reason? They were all
                                        suspected of practicing black magic or witchcraft. Though government
                                        has introduced a draft bill to tackle the social evil of witch hunts.
                                        The state Govt yet to take any legal action to try and curb the practice.
